# Automatic-Backup-System
The Backup System is a Java-based utility designed to automatically copy and safeguard files or directories to a secure backup location. This system helps users maintain regular backups of important data, preventing loss due to accidental deletion, system crashes, or data corruption.
Key Features:
Select source and destination directories for backup.

Automatically copies all files from the source to the backup location.

Can be enhanced with time-based or manual triggers for backup.
 Displays real-time backup status or logs for user tracking.
Handles exceptions like missing files, permission issues, and I/O errors.
 Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java

Concepts: File Handling, OOPs, Exception Handling, Input/Output Streams

Tools (Optional): NetBeans, Eclipse, Command-line Java compiler

 Learning Objectives:
Master Java File I/O operations and directory traversal.

Implement robust exception handling for file system operations.

Design utility classes and methods using clean object-oriented code.

Understand how data backup systems work at a basic software level.

 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas):
Add a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX.

Schedule automatic backups using Java Timer/ExecutorService.

Add file versioning to keep previous copies.

Integrate with cloud storage APIs (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
